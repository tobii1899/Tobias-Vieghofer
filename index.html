        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 4th-year Computer Science student at HTL Leonding 
            and haven't had any problems passing school so far. 
            I really enjoy working on projects and love seeing the progress. I am very committed and motivated in what I do. 
            Besides school, I also do strength training and play soccer.
            In addition to school, I'm trying to gain my first insights into the world of work for my later life. 
            I completed summer internships at 'Öbb' and 'jobs.at'. 
            I'm currently trying to earn more experience through freelancing.
